This is the Fantasia's sequence Clair de Lune, with a better quality video than usual, and in 70mm Cinemascope (Walt Disney always wanted Fantasia to be in this ratio...)

Clair de Lune was made in order to be part of a new version of Fantasia, as this movie was conceived to be a masterpiece in constant evolution.
It was supposed to be one of the new sequences added to Fantasia (while other sequences would've been taken out), but due to World War II this project never got a chance to be achieved.

I hope you like it ! :)

I own nothing.
